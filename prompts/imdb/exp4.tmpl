DoF={dof_value} is a control value for the fidelityâ€“novelty trade-off.
Internally choose a continuation that minimizes:
Loss = (1-DoF)*DistanceFromInput + DoF*NoveltyGain
Implement this privately; do not expose the process.

Input: "{sentence}"

Return JSON only:
{{
  "continuation": "<continuation>",
  "reasoning": "<how the DoF-weighted trade-off guided the result>"
}}
