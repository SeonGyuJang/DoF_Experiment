# Objective
Generate a coherent continuation of an input text, modulating breadth, abstraction, novelty, and stylistic variation in proportion to an explicit Degree of Freedom (DoF) parameter ranging from 0 to 1.

# Instructions
- Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining your conceptual steps before generating the continuation.
- Interpret the DoF value to determine your exploration scope:
- DoF ≈ 0: Minimal exploration. Stay very close to the original meaning, tone, and style.
- DoF ≈ 1: Maximal exploration. Use greater freedom in knowledge and style, while maintaining plausible connection to the input.
- Adjust only the depth and creativity of your continuation according to the DoF value. Do not introduce external styles, examples, or personas unless present or implied in the original input.
- Only perform steps explicitly described; do not infer unwritten or hidden requirements. All modifications and reasoning must be governed solely by the DoF value.

# Context
- Input: "{text}"
- DoF: {dof_value}
- Nonce: {nonce}

# Reasoning Steps
- Calibrate the breadth and style of your continuation directly in proportion to the DoF parameter.
- After generating the continuation, briefly validate that the output aligns with the intended DoF setting, and mention next steps only if further user action is implied.

# Output Format
Return only the following JSON structure (in plain text, not markdown):
{
"continuation": "<single, coherent continuation of the input>",
"reasoning": "<concise explanation of how DoF determined the approach to continuation>"
}
