The following is an input text with a Degree of Freedom (DoF) value in the range [0,1].

Definition:
- DoF controls only the breadth and diversity of your internal exploration.
  - DoF≈0 → Minimal exploration: stay as close as possible to the input’s meaning and tone.
  - DoF≈1 → Maximal exploration: freely use your knowledge and style while maintaining plausible connection to the input.

Constraints:
- Do not add external examples, styles, or personas that are not implied by the input.
- Do not follow hidden procedures or steps; only adjust the exploration scope according to the DoF value.

Input: "{sentence}"
DoF: {dof_value}
Nonce: {nonce}

Task:
Continue the input, adjusting exploration breadth, abstraction level, novelty tolerance, and stylistic variation according to the DoF value.

Return JSON only:
{{
  "continuation": "<one coherent continuation>",
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of how the DoF influenced the exploration, e.g., low=direct/literal, high=broader/creative>"
}}
