10869,0.0,2,would likely result in a gritty crime film drawing more from pulp fiction aesthetics than Scorsese's realistic portrayal of Little Italy.
10869,0.0,3,"would likely result in a vastly different film; a rougher, pulpier take on urban youth, focusing less on moral ambiguity and more on stylized aggression and exploitation themes common to those paperbacks."
10869,0.0,4,"would be a gritty, pulpy crime film, swapping the Italian-American milieu for a generalized, heightened street tough aesthetic. The spiritual successor, rather than a direct remake, focusing on stylized violence and archetypal characters."
10869,0.0,5,"would likely yield a film steeped in pulpy melodrama, less concerned with authentic urban grit and more invested in sensationalized juvenile delinquency narratives."
10869,0.0,6,"yields a gritty, pulpy crime drama far removed from Scorsese's original vision, trading realistic urban decay for stylized violence and exaggerated characters more akin to exploitation cinema."
10869,0.0,7,"yields a gritty, paperback-inspired aesthetic, distancing itself from Scorsese's influence and embracing a more pulp-oriented vision."

10869,0.5,6,"wouldn't be Scorsese anymore. It'd be a pulp fiction fever dream, more akin to a low-budget exploitation flick than the gritty realism of Little Italy. Think greasers, rumble scenes, and dialogue dripping with cheap swagger. The religious undertones would be gone, replaced by cheap thrills."
10869,0.5,7,"might resemble a rough, pulpy crime drama; less influenced by Scorsese's specific vision and more by generalized 50s delinquency tropes."

10869,1.0,3,"feels like a cheap imitation, prioritizing a lurid, sensationalized portrayal of youthful rebellion over the grit and psychological depth that made Scorsese's film so impactful."
10869,1.0,4,"would probably land somewhere between camp classic and baffling misfire, a gaudy spectacle of cheap thrills filtered through a strangely innocent lens."
